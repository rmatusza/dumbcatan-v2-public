# Dumb Catan

### This application is a browser-based, real-time, multiplayer clone of the "Settlers of Catan" board game built with React.js, Spring Boot, and MySQL
<br></br>

üöß This project is a work in progress. It is intended to be an improved version of my completed original app which can be found on my Github page: [Front end](https://github.com/rmatusza/DumbCatanClient-Public) ----- [Back end](https://github.com/rmatusza/DumbCatanServer-Public)  
The features mentioned in this README therefore apply to the future completed application and may not have all been implemented at the time of reading this. A list of the currently implemented features as well as in progress features can be viewed [at the bottom of this file](#feature-progress-log)
<br></br>

üöÄ You can run a demo version of this project locally to see and experiment with the features that have currently been implemented by following the instructions outlined in the README file within the [Demo Application Repository](https://github.com/rmatusza/dumbcatan-v2-demo)

# Why Is This Application Called "Dumb Catan" ?
The name takes inspiration from a TV show called "Nathan for You" in which Nathan Fielder, the host, attempts to help failing businesses get back on their feet by presenting the business owners with convoluted and ridiculous solutions. In one episode Nathan took advantage of California's Parody Law to help a failing coffee shop business by renaming and rebranding their business as "Dumb StarBucks" hoping that passersby would only see the "StarBucks" portion of the name and therefore increase business. It's a great episode and I've provided a link below to the video on youtube. In the same way that "Dumb StarBucks" is a clone of "StarBucks", so too is "Dumb Catan" a clone of one of my favorite board games called "Catan".
